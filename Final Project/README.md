# Sewage Overflows and the Relation to Heavy Rainfall Events
**Project description:**  I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the number of sewage overflow reports and the amount of rainfall in Baltimore City. 

## Data
I used data from the [Maryland Department of the Environment ]([url](https://mde.maryland.gov/programs/water/compliance/pages/reportedseweroverflow.aspx)) to find sewage overflow reports for Baltimore City, specifically from the year 2019.

#### 1. Graph showing the income and sewage reports. There is this idea that lower income communities do not have the resources or care to reach out to local municipalities for assistance because they feel like they will be ignored and overlooked more so than the more affluent communities that the city allocates a lot of resources to.

The map shows how income and submitted reports are correlated.

#### 2. Graph showing how population relates to the number of sewage reports. Here we can kind of see the pattern of "the Black Butterfly and the White L."

The map shows how population and submitted reports are correlated. Would we expect for more populated areas to have more reports?

#### 3. Graph showing how rainfall distrubtion compares to the number of submitted sewage overflow reports in 2019.

The map shows how population and submitted reports are correlated. Would we expect for more populated areas to have more reports?
