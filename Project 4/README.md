# Project 1: 

# Increased Street Flooding in Baltimore City
Climate change is influencing many different factors including changes in precipitation. With more rain, comes more flooding. Flooding is a growing issue in urban environments because of an increase in impervious surfaces such as roads and buildings and clogged strorm drains which prevent the water from going through the storm drain system. For this map I simply used data to show the distribution of where these reports were from the year 2020. 


# Data
311 data relating to obstructions in storm drains and street flooding reports was obtained from the City of Balimore via [OpenBaltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov)

# Processing & Transformations
I used simple tools for processing like select by attribute and joined the point data to the neighborhoods in order to represent the street flooding reports by neighborhood.

# Analysis
What did you learn? What is the **analysis** you'll be performing on your data sets? You may need to explain some of your R code not explained above.

# Results
What **outputs** will you be creating and how are they directly connected to the class? Explain your bin folder.
