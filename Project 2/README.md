# Project 2: 

# Storm Drain Reports
Storm drains being clogged contribute to the issue of street flooding. For part of my research into the question of street flooding, I am interested in seeing where some storm drain obstructions are. 

This particular map shows where 311 reports were generated for blocked storm drains in the City.



# Data
311 data relating to obstructions in storm drains and street flooding reports was obtained from the City of Balimore via [OpenBaltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov)

# Processing & Transformations
Are there any necessary **transformations or subsets** you need to do to the data? Explain your R code or your steps in QGIS.

# Analysis
What did you learn? What is the **analysis** you'll be performing on your data sets? You may need to explain some of your R code not explained above.

# Results
What **outputs** will you be creating and how are they directly connected to the class? Explain your bin folder.
