# Project 2: 

# Storm Drain Reports
Storm drains being clogged contribute to the issue of street flooding. For part of my research into the question of street flooding, I am interested in seeing where some storm drain obstructions are. 

This particular map shows where 311 reports were generated for blocked storm drains in the City.

# Data
311 data relating to obstructions in storm drains and street flooding reports was obtained from the City of Balimore via [OpenBaltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov)
