## Tyrah Cobb-Davis

### Introduction

This is the start to my very first portfolio and will be a place to house different projects that I have worked on. 

This setup is based on instructions by [Ivanna Kacewica](https://blog.usejournal.com/@evanca) on how to [Set Up Your Portfolio Website in Less Than 10 Minutes](https://medium.com/@evanca/set-up-your-portfolio-website-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-github-pages-d0efa8ff56fd) with Github Pages. The base minimal theme has [excellent documentation](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) for customizing.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
