And how does this compare to White American home ownership <img src="Project1_486/BIN/whiteownership.png?raw=true"/>
and total total ownership <img src="Project1_486/BIN/totalownership.png?raw=true"/>

# What Data Is Being Used And How Can This Be Accesssed?
The data used is from 1994 to 2021 and is provided by Table 22 on the [Housing Vacancies and Homeownership (CPS/HVS)](https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/ann21ind.html)

# Processing & Transformations Needed For Spatial Analysis
I used simple tools for processing like transposing the data so that I could better use it in R.

# Analysis That Will Be Performed On Datasets
I learned that there has been a shift in homeownership for many racial demographics during the last 27 years, from 1994 to 2021.

# Results; What Outputs Are Being Created And How Are They Related To Our Class?
I created maps in the style of WEB DuBois using the theme_dubois() library package in R.
