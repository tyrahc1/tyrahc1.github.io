# Baltimore City Rain Trends (2019)
 

# Data
The rainfall data was provided to me by Dr. Andy Miller of UMBC, but was created by Dr. Mary Lynn Baeck. The values are from a radar-rainfall dataset for Baltimore City.

# Processing & Transformations


# Analysis
I did a lot of data manipulation such as making the original rain data file in a long version rather than a wide dataset, I organized by grid number, did a few spatial joins, etc.

# Results
I created a series of maps to show how rain trends vary over the months, specifically April to September, because the rain data is collected within that 6 month period.
